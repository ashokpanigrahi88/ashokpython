# ORDER AND CART MANAGEMENT #

# Orders are list of ordered items
# An order item has four components:
# - a name
# - a quantity (the number of such items bought)
# - a price (in pence)
# - a weight (in pounds)
#
# DO NOT MODIFY CONSTANTS

    When a customer adds items to their basket, you need to update their
    order. The customer provides some of the details (the name of the item and
    the quantity they want); the CATALOGUE contains additional details (price
    and weight).

    NOTE: you must return a new order list and leave the argument unmodified.

    NOTE: if the order already contains some of the item, you must update the
    quantity field for that item; otherwise, you must add a new entry in the
    order

    NOTE: if the item cannot be found in the order or the catalogue, the function
    should return the original order.
